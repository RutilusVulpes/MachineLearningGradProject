Welcome to Mathew Gutierrez's Grad Project for machine learning.

I've included a mass spec viewer so that whoever wants can explore the data for themselves
to start, double click or enter

java -jar msDataServer-1.0.jar

on command line. Load in either the traces.csv to browse the hand annotated dataset in full
or load in the output of traceRecoverer.py which take the form of <traceId>.csv eg
151231.csv.

Please email mathewgutierrez00@gmail.com if you have any questions.

Happy Holidays.
